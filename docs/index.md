# [**Practical LTE FDD Capacity Dimensioning**](ltefdddimensioning.md)
This page contains documentation to estimate a cell capacity by calculating overheads using mainly statistics available from the NW. This would result in a slightly better estimate comparing to only Theoretical calculations.
I have tried to include the theoretical background as well in order to help the readers.
