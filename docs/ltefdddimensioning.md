# A Guide for LTE (FDD) Capacity Dimensioning

## Introduction
**Please read this section to understand if this guide is relevant to you.**

- This text is aimed to understand the **LTE-FDD** capacity calculations.
- The text shall try to explain how a future Traffic forecast can be translated into required resources based on **Statistics** and Observations from current Live Network.
- Essentially, this is a **practical dimensioning** exercise and **not** a theoretical one. Difference in both approaches is that for theoretical discussion, we assume a certain overhead for all our channels and work towards building the right model, whereas for practical dimensioning we shall get all these inputs via the available Statistics and plugin to our model to get desired results.

- I shall try to divide this text into **three** parts.
    1. Theoretical background and calculations **Read if you want to extend this documentation and want to gain a deeper understanding on the rationale**
    2. Defining required input statistics **Read if you are planning to use this model for your own network**
    3. Practical Modelling **Just read directly if you dont want to go theoretical and would like to check the practical impact only**
